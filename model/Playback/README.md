To be able to play the ANC audio and the original audio at the same time: 

1. First run "python find_devices.py" to find which devices are the laptop and the headphone system you want 
    (Use wired headphones as there's some latency issues with bluetooth)

2. Run "python play_anc_test.py" and set the device number of laptop and headphones
